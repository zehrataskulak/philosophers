# Philosophers

## Description

This project is an implementation of the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem, a well-known exercise in concurrent programming and synchronization. The goal is to simulate a group of philosophers sitting at a table, alternating between thinking and eating, while sharing limited resources (forks) without causing deadlocks or starvation.

# Instructions

## Compilation
To compile the project, run the following command in the philo directory:
```bash
make
```

## Execution
After compilation, execute the program with:
```bash
./philo <number_of_philosophers> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

Example:
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200
```

- `<number_of_philosophers>`: Number of philosophers and forks
- `<time_to_die>`: Time (ms) before a philosopher dies if they don't start eating
- `<time_to_eat>`: Time (ms) a philosopher spends eating
- `<time_to_sleep>`: Time (ms) a philosopher spends sleeping
- `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]`: (Optional) Simulation ends when each philosopher has eaten this many times

- POSIX Threads Programming
- Dining Philosophers Problem - Wikipedia


## Use of AI
AI was used to assist in the following specific tasks and parts of the project:

- Concept Comprehension: Learning and understanding the foundational mechanics of POSIX threads, mutexes, and concurrent programming concepts (like starvation and deadlocks) prior to and during implementation.

- Debugging Multithreading Issues: Analyzing ThreadSanitizer logs to identify and resolve data races and lock-order inversion in the monitor.c and routine.c logic.

- Testing: Creating an extensive automated bash script to run stress tests, check edge cases, and ensure memory safety across thousands of iterations.

- Documentation: Structuring and drafting this README file.
